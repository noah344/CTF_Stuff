# Solving
## My Thoughts
This challenge was annoying as it required a little bit of trial and error before getting the flag.  It's very easy to overthink as well.

## Webpage
Let's take a look at the webpage and the source code first:

![Webpage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ac0ad6-85a2-4295-a005-11808d114294)

![Source](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04a7d93-eeda-45e5-8779-3ebf7cbd2e1b)

Nothing too interesting, let's take a look at the cookies as suggested by the description and title.  We can find our cookies by looking at the storage tab (on firefox):

![Cookie](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d5e5b2d-71cb-479d-b995-18ff0b94d599)

Ok, we have a cookie here but again not much to go off of.  Let's try entering in a cookie into the search box and submitting it:

![Cookie 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3380abc-1ed8-4f03-9819-30e5c99284bf)

Interesting, so when we submit our cookie it sends a post request to check.  If it's a valid cookie, it'll respond with the new webpage.  We can also see that our cookie was updated from -1 to 0 interesting, let's try updating the cookie value to 1 and refresh the page to see what happens:

![Cookie 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69edc870-4de1-4260-a85e-e98babbf0ff4)

Ok, so the page provides different output depending on what the user's cookie value is set to.  Let's roll through them and see if we can get the flag:

![Cookie 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac57af1-779b-4dbb-bc55-6cf558e31f23)

Once we finally reach the value of 18 we get our flag!
