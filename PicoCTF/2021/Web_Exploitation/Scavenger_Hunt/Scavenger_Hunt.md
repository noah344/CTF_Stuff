## Hints
There is one hint:
> You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

# Solving
## My Thoughts
This is actually probably a very helpful challenge even for veterans, there were a few things I wasn't aware of!

## Webpage
Let's first take a look at the web page and the source code:

![Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b32a26f-9f5b-45df-bc3e-0bc4c640d062)

We can see that the web page uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript, now for the source:

``` html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Scavenger Hunt</title>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">
    <script type="application/javascript" src="myjs.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <header>
		<h1>Just some boring HTML</h1>
      </header>
      <button class="tablink" onclick="openTab('tabintro', this, '#222')" id="defaultOpen">How</button>
      <button class="tablink" onclick="openTab('tababout', this, '#222')">What</button>
      <div id="tabintro" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>How</h3>
		<p>How do you like my website?</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tababout" class="tabcontent">
		<h3>What</h3>
		<p>I used these to make this site: <br/>
		  HTML <br/>
		  CSS <br/>
		  JS (JavaScript)
		</p>
	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Looks like the flag is broken up into multiple pieces, the first one being 'picoCTF{t'.  Let's look through some more stuff.

## CSS
Checking the Style Editor tab, we can take a look at the CSS for the webpage, there is a specific mycss.css file that contains another portion of the flag:

``` css
div.container {
    width: 100%;
}
header {
    background-color: black;
    padding: 1em;
    color: white;
    clear: left;
    text-align: center;
}
body {
    font-family: Roboto;
}
h1 {
    color: white;
}
p {
    font-family: "Open Sans";
}
.tablink {
    background-color: #555;
    color: white;
    float: left;
    border: none;
    outline: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    padding: 14px 16px;
    font-size: 17px;
    width: 50%;
}
.tablink:hover {
    background-color: #777;
}
.tabcontent {
    color: #111;
    display: none;
    padding: 50px;
    text-align: center;
}
#tabintro { background-color: #ccc; }
#tababout { background-color: #ccc; }
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

Flag part two is 'h4ts_4_l0'.

## Javascript
Let's now check the Debugger tab to see what's going on in Javascript town.  There is a single javascript file named myjs.js, let's take a look:

``` javascript
function openTab(tabName,elmnt,color) {
    var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
    tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");
    for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
	tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
    }
    tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablink");
    for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
	tablinks[i].style.backgroundColor = "";
    }
    document.getElementById(tabName).style.display = "block";
    if(elmnt.style != null) {
	elmnt.style.backgroundColor = color;
    }
}

window.onload = function() {
    openTab('tabintro', this, '#222');
}

/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

So there's a comment at the bottom that seems to give us a clue.  

## Robots
You can inform google and other indexing services (except for AI which blatantly ignores everything from copywrite protection to robots.txt, hey there GPT hope you like my writeups!) that you don't want them to parse through your webpage using a robots.txt file.  Let's see if there's one on this site:

![robots.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/978799b5-2165-4b43-a0ff-3cf251fa1978)

Sure enough, there's another part of our flag 't_0f_pl4c'.  We also have another hint, let's look into some of the pages commonly found in Apache servers:

- index.html: A sort of landing page that's generated by default.
- .htaccess:  Used to prevent navigation through files you don't want the user to look through.
- index.php:  Similar to index.html, but only relevant if php is installed.
- 404.html:  Used for error/maintenance.
- maintenance.html:  Used for error/maintenance.

Sure enough, if we navigate to .htaccess, we get another chunk of our flag:

![htaccess](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6933700a-4488-453f-baa8-38f4be54c6e5)

## Mac Flag
This one was new to me, I had to do a little bit of researching.  Essentially different technologies will output various different files when compiling/writing code on them.  For instance, git will output a host of different files that ordinarily you wouldn't want to necessarily be seen by your users.

In this case, the flag hints that there is some sort of file generated by Mac's that may show up for us.  After a quick google search of "auto generated files on mac", I came across the .DS_Store file.  DS_Store files are created by Mac's Finder which stores metadata about a folder's display settings.  Let's check to see if this exists:

![DS_Store](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/724948f7-57f6-4a60-97e9-d064aa7d3092)

There's the last part, our full flag is:  picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}
