# Solving
## My Thoughts
Another challenge in a series that seems to be an intro to the web browser inspect tool.  This one shows you how to look at files that may not necessarily show up directly.

## Includes
Let's take a look at the site first as well as the source code:

![Webpage and Source](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e47f4018-7ba9-43bf-88e7-9fdfeb804b14)

Nothing too crazy there, we can see that there are two files that are not shown and instead are referenced:  script.js and style.css.

js files are javascript files and are typically used to run some sort of interactible function on the webpage.  css files are style sheets that help the webpage understand how it should render for the user.

So let's poke around the inspector and see if we can find those files, first we find the script.js file in the debugger which appears to have half of the flag:

Then we can check the style editor and we can see the other half:

Flag acquired, nice!
