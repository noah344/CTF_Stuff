# Solving
## My Thoughts
Another very simple challenge, but probably very good as an intro.

## Page Inspection
On navigating to the page we see the below:

![Webpage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcfeeb82-1347-4608-be29-6c74436cf1f0)

Weird but ok, let's follow the title and check out the inspect view:

![Flag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6be94f2-88e0-4493-9541-4ac28d3e5f12)

Well that was easy!  The flag is stored as a hidden comment in the source code.  Nice!
