# Solving
## My Thoughts
This is a solid intro to web exploitation and taking a look through the source code of web pages.
I think it took me ~30 seconds to solve, but is probably excellent for a beginner.

## Intro to Web Exploitation
When we connect to the website, we are presented with the below page:

![Webpage Login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd255fb-7861-4a13-8553-235824672803)

Let's take a look at the source code too, we can do that by right-clicking on the page and clicking 'inspect':

![Webpage Login Source](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edff111-c6bc-4147-bd55-451500bd5e6a)

This is fairly standard, when clicking the button the login.php page is called using the POST method, and the username and password entered by the user are transferred over.

Let's plug in something and see what happens, make sure you move over to the "Network" tab so we can take a look at the traffic.

![POST](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73a7ce9b-d52d-423a-9cac-83db9841565b)

As expected, we send the login stuff to the server via POST, you might notice there's another weird page in there that's called, secure.js?  Let's take a look at that too:

![secure.js](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fe7aa57-1306-4d9b-ae26-519b843499e9)

Well that's not very secure!  Let's try that login and see what we get:

![Flag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89327f02-05bf-4588-8d96-23f0f0f67595)

We got the flag! Awesome!
