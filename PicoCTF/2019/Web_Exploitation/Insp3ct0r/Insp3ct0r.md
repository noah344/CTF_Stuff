# Solving
## My Thoughts
This was almost identical to another challenge.  Meh.

## Inspector
We can inspect a web page use the various browsers' inspector tool to look at source code and other information.  The flag was located in three different places:

### Web Page Source in Inspector

![First](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e168c4a6-56a5-4161-832e-1e5a3b49570e)

### CSS View in Style Editor

![Second](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baf86df8-41c2-4ba3-91e6-2d5f665fe23e)

### Javascript View in Debugger

![Third](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/089f4c57-98ea-4d89-b78b-c7e1e42a45fc)

So our flag is:  'picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}'.
