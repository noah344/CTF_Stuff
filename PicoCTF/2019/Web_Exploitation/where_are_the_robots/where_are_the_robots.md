# Solving
## My Thoughts
Very simple intro to web exploitation.

## Solving
There is a file usually hosted on web servers called robots.txt.  This file will ordinarily tell web scrapers that the owner of the website does not want people scraping the site.

With the influx of AI, this wonderful little thing is borderline irrelevant as AI scrapers completely ignore robots.txt.  Anyways, here's what's inside robots.txt for the site:

![robots.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e124886-afc8-470d-b7b0-457eca3e490f)

So let's navigate to that page and see what we get:

![Flag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6795104f-1ece-4e39-814a-b8b1481a5c5b)

We got the flag!
