Direct Link: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/80

## Description
The Description reads:
> There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50009. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hints
There are two hints:
> There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
> Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

# Solving
## My Thoughts
This was a fun standard SQL injection challenge.

# Website
When we enter the website we are greeted with the below:

There's a bar at the top that opens a menu where we can see an admin login page:

Ok let's plug in some nonsense and see what we get:

We see a login failed screen and a fairly standard post request...except for that debug thing? What's that?  Let's try changing that and resending:

Sure enough that looks like a classic sql injection vulnerability, let's try out the classic 1=1 trick:

And sure enough we get our flag!:
