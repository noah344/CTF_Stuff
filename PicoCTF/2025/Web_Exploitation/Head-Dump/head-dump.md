This was the fourth challenge listed in PicoCTF 2025.  It's listed as easy and categorized as a Web Exploitation challenge.

## Description
The Description reads:
> Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag. The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.  
>
> Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Hints
There are two hints that read:
> Explore backend development with us

and  
> The head was dumped.

# Solving
## My Thoughts
I generally prefer challenges that mirror possible real world scenarios.  This one felt very weak on that front, regardless I got it solved so let's walk through it!

## The Webpage
The page is a very standard looking blog/social media platform as you can see below:

The hint very quickly clued me onto the second post by John Doe which says "Explore backend development with us".  For whatever reason, the '# API Documentation' tag leads directly to a directory with...API documentation as shown below:

![API](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed159164-cc6c-4160-be42-8771615c90f2)

Towards the bottom of the page is a get request for '/heapdump' with the description 'Diagnosing the memory allocation'.  Running heapdump downloads the below file:

![Heapdump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d2d1db-1a44-4ee2-857b-b6e5e6a25dfb)

99% of the file looks like this, I assume it's a memory dump from the web app or something similar:

![Heapdump Text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80e65f68-b6cf-477f-85a4-1dc7959b470e)

If we just search for the word 'pico' we find the flag.  I could go more in depth on how or why it works but...I was pretty disappointed by this challenge so I just moved on.
