# Cookie Monster Secret Recipe
This was a challenge for PicoCTF 2025.  It's listed as easy and categorized as a Web Exploitation challenge.

## Description
The Description reads:
> Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website.  
> As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret.  
> Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?  

## Hints
There are three hints that read:
> Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?  

> Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!  

and
> Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.  

# Solving
## My Thoughts
This challenge is great for people just starting out! From looking through the inspector in your browser, to understanding different types of text encoding you can learn quite a lot from this one!

## The Site
We're greeted by the below when we connect, nothing crazy!

![Site](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f8b367-545e-4054-98d5-c40db6185198)

When we plug in some random text, we're brought to this page:

I opened the inspector to the storage tab and took a look at the cookies, sure enough the secret_recipe cookie had some sort of text in there!  Let's look at it a little closer:

```
cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ%3D%3D
```

Hmmmm.

## Web Encoding
Web encoding is a special way of obfuscating text by masking certain characters in a format that is typically only readable by a web browser.  Web encoding is particularly useful in URL's where there may be a space in the URL, instead of having ' ', you could replace it with %20!

All web encoding is typically going to be a % sign followed up with two characters, in this case our string is terminated by %3D%3D, %3D is the web encoding of the = character.

So our actual string is now:  cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ==

Hmmmm.

## Base64 Encoding
Base64 is another way of encoding messages to make them unreadable.  Sometimes (not always), there will be padding in the form of equals signs at the end.  I'll use this time to introduce the amazing cyberchef site:  https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/

Cyberchef allows you to manipulate text in a ton of different ways, one of which is a base64 decode function.  So let's plug our text in and see what happens:

And just like that we have our flag!
