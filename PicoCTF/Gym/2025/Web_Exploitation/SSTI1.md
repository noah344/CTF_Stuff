# SSTI1
This was the first challenge listed in PicoCTF 2025.  It's listed as easy and categorized as a Web Exploitation challenge.

## Description
The Description reads:
> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
> I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!
## Hints
There is a single hint that reads:
> Server Side Template Injection

# Solving
This one was interesting, I hadn't been exposed to Server Side Template Injection (that's what the challenge is about in case the hint and title didn't make it clear).
There was a lot of trial and error with this one before finally getting the flag and a lot of research trying to understand how templating works.  As always starting with a little googling can't hurt!

A short search later I found some solid info on Github [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection).

Essentially the first step in figuring out your payload is that you need to determine what backend framework is being used.  This can be done by entering in various strings to try to get the server to error out, different frameworks have different triggers.

The catch-all to determine if a vulnerability exists at all should be this string:

```
${{<%[%'"}}%\.
```

In most applications this will trigger some sort of error
