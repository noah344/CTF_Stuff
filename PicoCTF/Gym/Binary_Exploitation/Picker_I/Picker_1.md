This was a challenge listed exclusively for the Pico Gym.  It's listed as Medium and categorized as a Binary Exploitation challenge.

## Description
The Description reads:
> This service can provide you with a random number, but can it do anything else?

## Hints
There are two hints:
> Can you point the program to a function that does something useful for you?

# Solving
## My Thoughts
This was a pretty simple challenge, but useful for understanding python.  I definitely don't think this should be qualified as medium.

## Source Code
Let's take a look at the source code, the useless functions were removed and comments were added:

``` python
import sys

# Calling this function will read in the flag from a text file and print it out.
def win():
  # Reads in the flag
  flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()
  # Cleans up the flag
  flag = flag.strip()
  str_flag = ''
  for c in flag:
    str_flag += str(hex(ord(c))) + ' '
  # Prints the flag
  print(str_flag)

# Loops continuously unless there's an error.
while(True):
  try:
    # Takes in user_input and stores it in the user_input variable.
    user_input = input('==> ')
    # Attempts to execute the user's input as actual python code using eval
    eval(user_input + '()')
  except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    break
```

So, let's just try to call the win function:

``` bash
==> win
0x70 0x69 0x63 0x6f 0x43 0x54 0x46 0x7b 0x34 0x5f 0x64 0x31 0x34 0x6d 0x30 0x6e 0x64 0x5f 0x31 0x6e 0x5f 0x37 0x68 0x33 0x5f 0x72 0x30 0x75 0x67 0x68 0x5f 0x63 0x65 0x34 0x62 0x35 0x64 0x35 0x62 0x7d
```

We get a bunch of hex data, ok.  Let's toss that in cyberchef:

And there's our flag!
